# The following requirements exist for building Apache HTTPd:
# apr/apr-util >= 1.2 (Apache Portable Runtime)
#       To use the bundled apr/apr-util sources specify the --with-included-apr option to configure.

# The character special files /dev/random and /dev/urandom provide an interface to the kernel's
# random number generator. The random number generator gathers environmental noise from device
# drivers and other sources into an entropy pool. The generator also keeps an estimate of the
# number of bits of noise in the entropy pool. From this entropy pool random numbers are created.

# Apache MPM worker
# A single control process (the parent) is responsible for launching child processes. Each child
# process creates a fixed number of server threads as specified in the ThreadsPerChild directive,
# as well as a listener thread which listens for connections and passes them to a server thread
# for processing when they arrive. Apache always tries to maintain a pool of spare or idle server
# threads, which stand ready to serve incoming requests. In this way, clients do not need to wait
# for a new threads or processes to be created before their requests can be served.
